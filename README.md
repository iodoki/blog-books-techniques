# Reading Moments

Reading a good book is like being around an inspiring person. You observe inspiring actions, feel contagious passion, and desire to live a better life. As a Software Engineer/Developer I am reading tech books because I want to put words into my code actions and decisions, and I don't mean writing better code comments. I would like to gain factual knowledge from the great authors and mentors of the field.

> By modeling what the business needs today, you will save a considerable amount of time, budget, code, and embarrassment. --Vernon, Vaughn. Domain-Driven Design Distilled (p. 95). 

Reading just an article is not enough for me, I am missing parts of the puzzle. Thus, I have decided to keep notes and write a book overview or review from tech field books. So I can come back to them and refresh or keep reference of the concepts. In case that you are curious which are the books that have inspired me or are helping me to be a better developer of the field, are [here](https://github.com/mdoklea/books/wiki).
