# Progress by Reading

Reading a good book is like being around an inspiring person. You observe inspiring actions, feel contagious passion, and desire to live a better life. As a Software Engineer/Developer I have been many times in the situation of writing code but hardly could explain and articulate the decisions after a part of code. All those moments of embarrassment and frustration led me to read more and more. I would like to gain factual knowledge from the great authors and mentors of the field and contribute to effective design software.

> By modeling what the business needs today, you will save a considerable amount of time, budget, code, and embarrassment. --Vernon, Vaughn. Domain-Driven Design Distilled (p. 95). 

Reading just an article is not enough for me, I am missing parts of the puzzle. Thus, I have decided to keep notes and write a book overview or review from tech field books. So I can come back to them and refresh or keep reference of concepts. In case that you are curious which are the books that have inspired me or are helping me to be a better developer of the field, are [here](https://github.com/mdoklea/books/wiki).
