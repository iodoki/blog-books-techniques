# Book Time

I can read books at any place at any time but most I like to read a book with a cup of coffee and in my favourite corner of the house. The times that I really liked a book I speed up to finish it. I can tell you even the next day I just had an impression of what had read. Unfortunately, I couldn't articulate my thoughts or give a feedback for that book. So sad! I felt horrible to spend time on something that I really loved, but I could barely remember parts of it as time passed.

My bad habbits enough is enough! ...And somehow like this I started looking for ways and tips to be a better reader and why not a confident writer.
