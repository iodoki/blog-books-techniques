# Reading Moments

I can read books at any place at any time but most I like reading a book with a cup of coffee and in my favourite corner of the house. Anytime that I really liked a book I speed up to finish it. I can eveb tell you the next day I just had an impression of what had read. Unfortunately, I couldn't articulate my thoughts or give a feedback for that book. So sad! I felt horrible to spend time on something that I really loved, but could barely remember parts of it as time passed.

My bad habbits enough is enough! ...And somehow like this I started looking for ways and tips to be a better reader and why not a confident writer in the future. Not only I got motivated but also effectively joining book clubs, holding conversations and my analytical thinking was stimulated merely from reading. Holding a presentation would be hard without keeping notes beforehand.

Reading a good book is like being around an inspiring person. You observe inspiring actions, feel contagious passion, and desire to live a better life. As a Software Engineer/Developer I am reading tech books because I want to put words into my code actions, and I don't mean code comments. I would like to gain factual knowledge from the great authors and mentors of the field. Reading just an article is not enough for me, I am missing parts of the puzzle. Thus, I have decided to keep notes and write a book overview or review from tech field books, so I can come back to them and refresh or keep reference of the concepts. In case that you are curious which are the books that have inspired me or are helping me to be a better engineer of the field is [here](https://github.com/mdoklea/books/wiki).
